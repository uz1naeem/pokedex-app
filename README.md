# Pokédex Project

## Overview

This Pokédex project is a web-based application that allows users to browse and search for Pokémon by name or number. It leverages the PokéAPI to fetch Pokémon data dynamically and provides detailed information about each Pokémon, including their stats, types, weight, and abilities. The project includes sorting features, a clean interface for navigation, and the ability to click on a Pokémon to view its detailed profile.

## Motivation

As someone who grew up watching Pokémon, this project was both a nostalgic journey and a chance to develop my JavaScript skills. I wanted to build something that not only tested my ability to work with public APIs but also gave me practical experience with modern web development techniques, such as DOM manipulation, API handling, and interactive user interfaces. It also provided me an opportunity to learn how to fetch, process, and display external data in a structured and user-friendly way.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained experience in:

- **JavaScript DOM manipulation**: Dynamically updating content based on user interaction and data fetched from an API.
- **Async/Await and Fetch API**: Handling asynchronous operations, managing API responses, and error handling.
- **CSS & Responsive Design**: Ensuring the project works across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Working with public APIs**: Consuming external APIs, specifically PokéAPI, and understanding how to process large amounts of data.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Designing a user-friendly interface that is simple and intuitive to use.

## Features

- **Browse Pokémon**: View the original 151 Pokémon with their images, names, and ID numbers.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for Pokémon by name or number dynamically using a search input.
- **Sorting Options**: Sort the list of Pokémon by name or number.
- **Detail Page**: View detailed information about a selected Pokémon, including stats, abilities, and a dynamic background that reflects the Pokémon’s type.
- **Navigation**: Quickly navigate between different Pokémon using next/previous buttons on the detail page.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors or invalid data by redirecting users when necessary.
  
## Problem It Solves

This project provides a simple, efficient way to access information about Pokémon without requiring users to navigate through complex databases or websites. It brings all the data together in one place, allowing users to enjoy browsing, searching, and learning about their favorite Pokémon.

## Installation & Running the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a code editor (such as Visual Studio Code) and a web browser installed. Since this is a static web app, no server setup is required.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
3. **Open the project in your code editor or simply double-click `index.html` to view the project in a browser.**

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Sorting/Filtering**: Introduce more sorting options like by Pokémon type or base stats.
- **Favorites**: Allow users to mark certain Pokémon as favorites and easily access them.
- **Expanded Pokémon Data**: Load data beyond the original 151 Pokémon for a more complete Pokédex experience.

## Conclusion

This Pokédex project was an excellent way to sharpen my JavaScript skills while working with APIs. It allowed me to create a functional and interactive user interface that I enjoyed building. Additionally, working on something connected to my childhood memories made this project especially rewarding.
